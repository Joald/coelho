Fake Paulo Coelho Quote Generator

Have you ever wanted to see the output of your `ls` spoken by Paulo Coelho?

Or maybe wanted to give your `grep` output that extra motivational **oomph**?

Or maybe you just thought of something you thought was profound but was afraid people would laugh at you unless it was spoken by an authority?

Fret not! This simple command line utility is here for all your fake Paulo Coelho quote image needs!



Features: 
- Accepts quote text from CLI args or stdin!
- You can choose where your quote image is saved!
- And you can even look at the entire quote after generation <sub><sub>(if it's not too long)</sub></sub>!

TODOs:
- fit text to image (important!)
- multiline quotes (part of the above)
- support different image types
- support different quote templates (probably through a config file defining them and bounds of their text boxes?)
